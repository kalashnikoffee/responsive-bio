# Responsive-Bio Homework
This is responsive bio/portfolio made using bootstrap and inline styling, it is my first attempt at building a site with Bootstrap. The general idea is that the site layout will adjust depending on the type/size of screen it is being viewed on. The baseline site should look like the following images.
